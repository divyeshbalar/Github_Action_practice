        3> Thread Scheduler will pick one of the thread from Runnable state and will execute it which will lend it to Running state
        4> Running: the thread gets execute here and if a thread is waiting for any i/o or network request or memory or computation, Thread schedular will change its state to not running
        5> Not Running: it contains the threads which are waiting for some i/o or network request or memory, once ready, it will again go to runnable state.
        6> Terminated: it is a state when the run() method has exited
